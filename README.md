# Credit Card Fraud with Tensorflow
______

This repo includes the following files as part of a a submission for the Capstone project of the ML Engineering course:
1. `report.pdf` contains the final project report
1. `proposal.pdf` contains the original project proposal
1. `train_fraud_model.ipynb` contains all of the code needed to train, deploy the model and produce the visualizations present in the report. Please note that reporducibility with Tensorflow is a challenge and as such, the resulting numbers should be close, but may not match exactly. Importantly this notebook was run using **AWS Sagemaker Studio** (not Sagemaker Notebooks) and a Python 3 Data Science kernel.
1. `requirements.txt` contains the base requirements needed to run the notebook, but need not be referenced. A sagemaker notebook in Sagemaker Studio using the data science image should be able to run the submitted notebook without issue.
1. `train/` is a folder containing custom code for training the Tensorflow model.
